  # Adding a new translation with Lingua

  Lingua manages localization in a Google Sheet and generates platform files (iOS `.strings` /
  `.stringsdict` / `Lingua.swift`, Android `strings.xml`) from it. Translations are organized
  by **section** (a logical group like `onboarding`, `errors`, `favorites`) and **key** (a
  `snake_case` identifier).

  **Never hardcode a user-facing string.** Use this skill to add it to the sheet first.

  ## Files you must NEVER create or hand-edit

  These are **generated** by `lingua sync` (or `lingua ios` / `lingua android`) from the Google
  Sheet. The sheet is the single source of truth.

  - `Lingua.swift` (the generated enum, usually under `Resources/Localization/`)
  - `**/*.lproj/Localizable.strings`
  - `**/*.lproj/Localizable.stringsdict`
  - Android `**/values*/strings.xml`

  If a `Lingua.<Section>.<key>` reference doesn't compile after you added a key, the answer is
  **never** to edit `Lingua.swift`. The answer is always one of:

  1. You forgot to run `lingua sync` after `lingua add` → run it now.
  2. The section name is lowercase but should be capitalized (`login` vs `Login`) → use
     `lingua delete` to remove the bad rows and re-add with the correct casing.
  3. The key contains characters that don't map cleanly to a Swift identifier → re-add with a
     valid `snake_case` key.

  ## Inputs you must gather before running

  - The English text of the new string.
  - The screen / feature it belongs to (used to pick the section).
  - The path to the project's `lingua_config.json`.

  ## Procedure

  1. **Check for an existing key first.** Duplication is the most common mistake.
     ```bash
     lingua find ./lingua_config.json "<english text>"
     ```
     If a close match exists, **stop and suggest reusing it** instead of creating a new key.

  2. **List existing sections + languages** so you place the new key in the right group AND
     know which languages need values.
     ```bash
     lingua sections ./lingua_config.json
     ```
     Read the JSON output. Two things matter:
     - `data.languages` is the list of language tabs in the sheet (e.g. `[{"code":"en",...},{"code":"de",...}]`).
       **You must provide a `--value` for every language code in this list** (see step 4).
       Skipping a language leaves the row blank in that tab and risks misaligning future
       writes.
     - `data.sections` is the list of existing sections. Pick the right one using these
       heuristics, in order:
       1. The feature folder of the file the new string will be used in
          (`Features/Onboarding/...` → `onboarding`).
       2. The closest existing section name semantically.
       3. As a **last resort**, propose a new section — explicitly tell the user
          *"I'm about to create a new section `X`, is that what you want?"* before passing
          `--new-section`.

  3. **Pick a `snake_case` key** that's specific to the screen/intent, not the literal text.
     Prefer `empty_state_message` over `no_favorites_yet` — keys should describe purpose, not
     content.

  4. **Add the row** with a `--value` for **every language** returned by `lingua sections`.
     If you don't speak a language, translate the English text yourself or ask the user — but
     never skip a language.
     ```bash
     lingua add ./lingua_config.json \\
       --section onboarding \\
       --key cta_start \\
       --value en="Get started" \\
       --value de="Loslegen"
     ```

     **Plural form column:** by default `lingua add` writes the value into whichever plural
     column the sheet's existing rows use (auto-detected — usually `one` for non-plural strings,
     matching the README template). You almost never need to think about this. Only override
     when adding an actually-plural string:
     ```bash
     lingua add ./lingua_config.json \\
       --section cart \\
       --key item_count \\
       --value en:one="1 item" --value en:other="%d items" \\
       --value de:one="1 Artikel" --value de:other="%d Artikel"
     ```
     The syntax is `<lang>:<form>=<text>` where `<form>` is one of `zero`, `one`, `two`, `few`,
     `many`, `other` (CLDR plural categories). For non-plural strings, omit the `:form` part
     entirely — Lingua will pick the right column for you.
     Parse the JSON response. Handle errors:
     - `error.code == "duplicate_key"` → stop, surface the existing row, suggest reusing it.
     - `error.code == "unknown_section"` → re-read `error.details.suggestions`, ask the user.
       **Do not auto-pass `--new-section`.**
     - `error.code == "tabs_out_of_sync"` → run `lingua doctor` and surface its output.
       Recovery: if you just created the orphan row, use
       `lingua delete ./lingua_config.json --section <s> --key <k>` to remove it from every
       tab where it exists, then retry the add with values for *all* languages.
     - `error.code == "missing_service_account"` → tell the user to set
       `serviceAccountKeyPath` in their `lingua_config.json` and run `lingua doctor`.

  5. **Regenerate platform files.**
     ```bash
     lingua sync ./lingua_config.json --platform ios
     ```
     (Also run with `--platform android` if both are configured.)

  6. **Use the new key in code** with the canonical reference syntax:
     - iOS: `Lingua.Section.key` (e.g. `Lingua.Onboarding.cta_start`)
     - Android: `R.string.section_key` (e.g. `R.string.onboarding_cta_start`)

  > **Section separators are automatic.** When `lingua add --new-section` creates a new
  > section in a non-empty sheet, it automatically leaves one blank row above the new section
  > for visual separation. You don't need to do anything; don't ask the user to add it
  > manually, and don't try to insert a blank row yourself.

  ## Hard rules

  - Always run `lingua find` and `lingua sections` *before* `lingua add`. Never skip them.
  - Never pass `--new-section` without explicit user confirmation.
  - **Never create or edit `Lingua.swift`, `Localizable.strings`, `Localizable.stringsdict`, or
    Android `strings.xml`.** They're regenerated from the sheet by `lingua sync`. If they look
    wrong, the fix is in the sheet (via `lingua add`/`update`/`delete`) followed by
    `lingua sync` — never with a text editor.
  - Never reach for `Write` or `Edit` on a file under `outputDirectory` or
    `swiftCode.outputSwiftCodeFileDirectory` from `lingua_config.json`. Those directories
    contain only generated artifacts.

  # Updating an existing translation with Lingua

  ## Procedure

  1. **Find the row.**
     ```bash
     lingua find ./lingua_config.json "<text or key>"
     ```
     If multiple matches, ask the user which `(section, key)` to update.

  2. **Update in place.**
     ```bash
     lingua update ./lingua_config.json \\
       --section onboarding \\
       --key cta_start \\
       --value en="Begin" \\
       --value de="Anfangen"
     ```
     `lingua update` only touches the cells you specify. By default it updates whichever plural
     column the existing row uses (so non-plural strings stay non-plural). To target a specific
     plural form, use `--value <lang>:<form>=<text>`:
     ```bash
     lingua update ./lingua_config.json \\
       --section cart \\
       --key item_count \\
       --value en:other="%d things"
     ```

     Errors to handle:
     - `error.code == "not_found"` → the row doesn't exist; suggest `lingua-add-translation`.
     - `error.code == "tabs_out_of_sync"` → run `lingua doctor`.

  3. **Regenerate platform files.**
     ```bash
     lingua sync ./lingua_config.json --platform ios
     ```

  ## Hard rules

  - `update` never moves rows. It only changes values in place.
  - Only languages you pass with `--value` are touched. Others stay as-is.
  - **Never create or edit `Lingua.swift`, `Localizable.strings`, `Localizable.stringsdict`, or
    Android `strings.xml`.** They're regenerated from the sheet by `lingua sync`. If a string
    on screen still looks wrong after `lingua update`, run `lingua sync` again — don't reach
    for a text editor.

  # Regenerating localization files

  lingua sync ./lingua_config.json --platform android

  Run only the platforms configured in `lingua_config.json`. After running, show
  `git diff --stat` of the output directory so the user can see what changed.

  If the sync fails, run the `lingua-doctor` skill.

  ## Generated files — never hand-edit

  Everything `lingua sync` writes is generated from the Google Sheet:

  - `Lingua.swift` (the generated enum)
  - `**/*.lproj/Localizable.strings`
  - `**/*.lproj/Localizable.stringsdict`
  - Android `**/values*/strings.xml`

  These files have a header comment saying *"This file was generated with Lingua command line
  tool. Please do not change it!"* — respect it.

  **If a generated file looks wrong:**

  - Empty or missing entries → the section name probably has wrong casing in the sheet (e.g.
    `login` instead of `Login`). Use `lingua list` to inspect, then `lingua delete` + re-add
    with the right casing.
  - Stale values → re-run `lingua sync`.
  - Missing entirely → check `outputDirectory` in `lingua_config.json` and run `lingua doctor`.

  **Never** "fix" a generated file by editing it directly. Any hand-edit is overwritten on the
  next `lingua sync`, and worse, it masks the real bug in the sheet.
